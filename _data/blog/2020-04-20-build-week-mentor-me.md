## My role was a UI Developer during this first build week project for Lambda School.

It's basically a fancy way of saying I had to make a website built only with HTML/CSS that described the product and it's features. 

**What is Build Week?** Every fifth week at Lambda School is Build Week, where we spend four days with a small team of students from different cohorts building out a more robust project.

For this project, I was wrapping up my intro to web studies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) before heading into React. This was a final project to test what I have learned and apply it within a team of other developers.
