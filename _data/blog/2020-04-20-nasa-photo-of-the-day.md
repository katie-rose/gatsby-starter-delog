## This was a small React project that I got super interested in and fleshed out a nice site.

A typical school day at Lambda consists of 2 hours of lecture and a project after lunch that you have ~4 hours to complete.

Every now and then you get something that really catches your interest and in this case, once I found out we had to work with NASA's API I was really excited. 

The goal was to pull the photo of the day and display it. I got a little fancy and setup a calendar so you could pull a photo from the past as well. Eventually I found the earliest photo of the day in their database (06-20-1995) by manually going through and seeing what came up with my inquiries. 

It kinda killed my idea to make this about everyone's birthday since the database works the best with kids younger than me but I figured it was still a cool idea and prompted someone to get curious about what has happening in space.
