## My role was a Front-End Architect during this third build week project for Lambda School.

I helped two other women, [Jade Lopez](https://github.com/jadeli1720) and [Eunice Baiden](https://github.com/ebisLab) build out the front-end part of this project. They fleshed out a majority of the React components and I worked on Redux.

**What is Build Week?** Every fifth week at Lambda School is Build Week, where we spend four days with a small team of students from different cohorts building out a more robust project.

For this project, I was wrapping up my React/Redux studies before heading into Node.js. This was a final project to test what I have learned and apply it within a team of other developers. 

We spent [roughly ~30 hours](https://wakatime.com/@1a34e01d-6590-4454-8ec0-e308230a4dfe/projects/kwyofzggcq?start=2019-06-01&end=2019-07-31) on this while talking on Zoom. I was a couple weeks ahead in my curriculum which meant I had the opportunity to help out Jade and Eunice with their React related questions. 

### Goals

Our assignment was to create a site that operated as Yelp, but for hair stylists. It's a go-to quick lookup for local hair stylists so that any curious customer can find the information they need to make a decision about booking an appointment.

**Profile Feature**

Every stylist had a stylist type list (barber, cosmetologist, stylist, etc) avatar, bio, and rating. Below that was a list of services with prices they set themselves, a booking option, a portfolio, and an address listed.
