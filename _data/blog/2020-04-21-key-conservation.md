## [Key Conservation](https://keyconservation.org/) is helping conservationists gain critical funding and global support through a mobile app that provides real-time updates on day-to-day campaigns.

I was a Team Lead for this project for 6 months and a student for 16 weeks.

### Student Goals

Labs is the first step into the wild as a Lambda Student. You are done with the Web curriculum (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Advanced React, Node.js), and now it's time to bring all of those skills together to work on a real project.

You have 16 weeks to complete a Product Cycle that is broken up into two parts: 4 weeks of one Release Cycle and another 4 weeks of another Release Cycle. This means you want to two main features that stand out for each of those 4 weeks. 

Our group decided on the following: 1. User Interaction and Bug Fixes. 2. Video Uploading and Profile Changes. We accomplished all our goals for both and was happy to show Megan, our stakeholder, the progress on the app. It was finally starting to come together in a social way.

### Team Lead Goals

As a student I learned many things: 1. Picking up React Native quickly isn't that hard to do thanks to the similarity with React. 2. The relationship with your stakeholder matters a lot, especially when she has a very clear vision of how the app should look and feel.

I knew the previous Team Leads did a great job at getting the app running from nothing and establishing the beginning stages but going into the third Product Cycle I knew a lot of organization and communication efforts had to be improved. 

Thankfully, I developed a great relationship with Megan during my time as a student and scheduled meetings with her to go over *everything*. From the smallest details on the app to the relationship with Lambda's UX cohort. We had honest conversations about it all. The growth from a student to a Team Lead is an experience I'll never forget, and it began with setting up the Labs 18 group for success.
